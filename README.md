# 📢 Advertisement Click Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview
This is a **machine learning-based web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various features. The app allows users to:
- Upload a CSV dataset 📂
- Explore data with visualizations 📊
- Train machine learning models 🤖
- Make predictions 🔍

## 🚀 Features
✅ Upload dataset (CSV format)  
✅ View dataset summary (shape, missing values, statistics)  
✅ Visualize data (heatmaps, feature distributions, class distributions)  
✅ Handle imbalanced datasets using **SMOTE**  
✅ Train models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM**  
✅ Display model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)  
✅ Predict advertisement clicks using user input  

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/advertisement-click-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd advertisement-click-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📂 Dataset Requirements
The dataset should be in **CSV format** and contain numerical features with a target variable (binary: `0` or `1`). The last column should represent whether the ad was clicked (`1`) or not (`0`).

## 🎯 Machine Learning Models Used
